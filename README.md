# The Derivative Delimma

This repository contains the python code to create mathematical animation video as shown [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrNnyHzv1H0).

It uses mathematical animation library [Manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html). 

## About the Video
Through a sneaky mathematical trick, we discuss the nuances in the notion of derivative.

First, we start with a brain-teaser to charge-up your brain.
Then we look at derivatives from the first-principles to re-investigate the problem with our _sneaky mathematical trick_.

Feel free to ask further questions and use the code as you may find useful. 

Further suggestions or collaborations on the mathematical animation videos are very welcome.
